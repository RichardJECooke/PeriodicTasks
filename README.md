# Periodic Tasks

Each top level folder is the same app written in a different framework.



## History

- First tried Neutralino.js. Little things like file picker file extension filter didn't work. Then big things like file watcher didn't work. Gave up. Next trying Electron. After that, Tauri/TS to see what a proper webview app looks like (<600kb). Then Fyne and Go. Then C#/Avalonia. Then TS/GTK.
